When validating something like an email address,phone number or ssn there are some things to consider

 * you may not always want them to validate (not required) 
 * you should probably check for length first
 * if you want to validate that a field is not empty and is a phone a number
   
   @NotEmpty
   @Phone
   
   
What about validating relationships

 * need to try a couple of examples
 *
 
What about context

 * not all validations should happen all of the time
 * context should default to context="*"
 * you could use context="save,changePassword"
