	If you want to run multiple MG applications under the same
	application name, change this value to something unique
	to this application to prevent them from colliding in the 
	application scope.

	**CUSTOM APPLICATION CONFIGURATION**
	
  If your path to ColdSpring.xml is custom, change it here.  Otherwise,
  it will default to Config/ColdSpring.xml
	
	<cfset ModelGlue_LOCAL_COLDSPRING_PATH = expandPath(".") & "/config/ColdSpring.xml" />
--->

<!---
	**CUSTOM CORE CONFIGURATION**

  If your path to ModelGlueConfiguration.xml is custom, change it here.  Otherwise,
  it will default to /ModelGlue/gesture/configuration/ModelGlueConfiguration.xml

	<cfset ModelGlue_CORE_COLDSPRING_PATH = "/ModelGlue/gesture/configuration/ModelGlueConfiguration.xml" />

	**HIERARCHIAL BEAN FACTORY SUPPORT**

	If you'd like to designate a parent bean factory for the one that powers Model-Glue,
	simply do whatever you need to do to set the following value to the parent bean factory 
	instance:
	
	<cfset ModelGlue_PARENT_BEAN_FACTORY = ??? />
--->

<cfset ModelGlue_LOCAL_COLDSPRING_DEFAULT_PROPERTIES  = application.defaults />

<cfset ModelGlue_PARENT_BEAN_FACTORY = application.factory />

<!--- If your path to ModelGlue.cfm is different, you'll need to change this line. --->
